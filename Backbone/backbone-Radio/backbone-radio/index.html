        <p>The Radio does job ,that letting you perform actions across your
           application without needing to maintain references to otherwise unrelated views or models.</p>
<h3>How Radio Works???</h3> 
<p>The Radio works by using the Backbone Events system you may be familiar with. 
   You can fire an event on your Radio and any other objects listening to that event 
   will pick it up and respond.</p>
   
   <p>The Radio also provides an API for handling Request/Response patterns — essentially 
       functions called without having direct access to them.</p>
      <p>
          <h4>The Radio message bus exposes some core concepts:</h4>
            
            <strong>Channel </strong>- a namespace mechanism.This minimizes the chances of naming collisions across the app,
             and provides additional semantic guidance for future readers of the code<br>
            <strong>Event</strong>  - alert other parts of your application that something happened.The Radio Event works exactly 
            the same way as regular Backbone Events like model/collection events. In fact, it uses the Backbone.
            Events mixin internally, exposing its API:<br>
            <strong> Request</strong>  - execute single functions in a different part of your application.
        </p>

 <h3>Radio Patterns</h3>  
 <p>The Backbone Radio provides two major patterns: Events and Requests.</p>
