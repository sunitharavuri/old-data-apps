<h1>Observer-Pattern </h1>
<p>The Observer is a design pattern where an object (known as a subject) maintains a list of objects 
    depending on it (observers), automatically notifying them of any changes to state.</p>
<p> If we need a way to update parts of a page in response to certain events, with the data these provide
    For example user input that you then project into one or many components. This leads into a lot of push-and-pull 
    in the code to keep everything in sync.For this we use Observer Pattern  it enables one-to-many data binding
     between elements. This one-way data binding can be event driven. With this pattern, you can build reusable 
     code that solves for your specific needs.
</p>
<h1>A high-level view of the pattern looks like this:</h1>
        
      <p> EventObserver
        │ 
        ├── subscribe: adds new observable events
        │ 
        ├── unsubscribe: removes observable events
        |
        └── broadcast: executes all events with bound data</p>
