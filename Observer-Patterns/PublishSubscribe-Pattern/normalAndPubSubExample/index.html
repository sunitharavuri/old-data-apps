    <p>This pattern uses an event system that sits between the objects wishing to receive notifications 
        (subscribers) and the objects firing the events (the publishers). This event system allows code 
        to define application specific events which can pass arguments containing values needed by the subscriber.
         The goal is to avoid dependencies between the subscriber and the publisher.</p>

   <p>In software architecture, publishâ€“subscribe is a messaging pattern where senders of messages, 
       called publishers, do not program the messages to be sent directly to specific receivers, 
       called subscribers. Instead, published messages are characterized into classes, without knowledge of what, 
       if any, subscribers there may be. Similarly, subscribers express interest in one or more classes, and only
        receive messages that are of interest, without knowledge of what, if any, publishers there are.</p>
